Simple Email Sending Example for Cocoa
===========

This example Xcode project shows how to send an email from within a Cocoa application. It does not require that the user have any mail client configured. It requires you to specify a mail server and account to use in the code.

This code was adapted from the Growl project. The original code can be found at:

It makes use of simple-mailer.py by Peter Hosey
